The Sweet Relief Glycogen Support formula aids in regulating insulin production and enhances the body's ability to control blood sugar. It improves the sensitivity of cells to insulin, ensuring better glucose uptake and utilization. Besides managing blood sugar levels, this supplement also includes ingredients that promote better sleep. Adequate sleep is essential for overall health and optimal body function, making it an important aspect of maintaining balanced blood sugar levels and overall health.
